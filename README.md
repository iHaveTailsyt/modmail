# Modmail for Discord
Modmail Bot is a bot for [Discord](https://discord.com/) that allows users to DM the bot to contact the server's moderators/staff
without messaging them individually or pinging them publically on the server.
These DMs get relayed to modmail *threads*, channels where staff members can reply to and talk with the user.
To the user, the entire process happens in DMs with the bot.

Inspired by Reddit's modmail system.

**⚠ Note on updating to v3.7.0:**

Always take a backup of your `db/data.sqlite` file before updating the bot.
